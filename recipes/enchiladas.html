<p>Enchiladas are a traditional Mexican dish with origins dating back to the Aztec Empire and earlier Mesoamerican civilizations. Indigenous peoples in Mexico were known to use corn tortillas as a staple food, filling them with various ingredients and rolling or folding them for convenience.</p>
<p>The term "enchilada" comes from the Spanish word enchilar, which means "to season with chili." This reflects the practice of dipping tortillas in chili sauces, a hallmark of the dish.</p>

<h2>Ingridients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons chili powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the Filling</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups shredded cooked chicken, beef, or beans (for a vegetarian option)<li>
    <li>1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a blend)</li>
    <li>1 small onion, diced (optional)</li>
    
</ul>
<h3>For Assembly</h3>
<ul>
    <li>8-10 corn tortillas (or flour tortillas, if preferred)</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded cheese for topping</li>
    <li>Optional toppings: sour cream, chopped cilantro, diced tomatoes, avocado slices, or jalapeños.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Sauce </li>
    <ul>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and whisk until lightly golden and bubbly (about 1-2 minutes).</li>
        <li>Stir in the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and oregano.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the broth, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.</li>
        <li>Simmer the sauce for 5-7 minutes until slightly thickened. Add salt to taste and set aside.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <li>Prepare the Filling</li>
    <ul>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the shredded chicken (or other filling), 1 cup of shredded cheese, and diced onion if using.</li>
    </ul>
     <br>

    <li>Soften the Tortillas</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat a small amount of oil in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Lightly fry each tortilla for a few seconds on both sides to soften them. This prevents cracking when rolling.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <li>Assemble the Enchiladas</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of enchilada sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place a tortilla on a flat surface, spoon some filling into the center, and roll it tightly.</li>
        <li>Place the rolled tortilla seam-side down in the baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <li>Top and Bake</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Pour the enchilada sauce evenly over the rolled tortillas, ensuring they are fully coated.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 5-10 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <li>Serve</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Garnish with your favorite toppings like sour cream, cilantro, or avocado slices.</li>
        <li>Serve warm and enjoy your homemade enchiladas!</li>
    </ul>
